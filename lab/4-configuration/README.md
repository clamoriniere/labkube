# Application Configuration

Configuration of an application may be done through:

- Environment Variables
- Files
- Services

Grabbing your configuration using a Service is something that you can do using the Service Discovery as described in lab3: Service

## Environment variables

Environment variables can directly be set inside the pod definition at container level. We had an example with HOSTNAME in the first lab:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: labkube
  name: labkube-env
spec:
  containers:
  - image: cedriclamoriniere/labkube:v1
    env:                                    # <-- section for environment variables
    - name: MY_LABKUBE_VAR
      value: "Hello from the environment"
    name: labkube
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
```

It is possible to inject in environment variables some values that comes from different sources ( see the api [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/) ):

- fieldRef: pod information. You have access to the invariant information such as:
  - metadata.name
  - metadata.namespace
  - spec.nodeName
  - spec.serviceAccountName
  - status.hostIP
  - status.podIP
- resourceFieldRef: information about limits and requests of memory and cpu
- configMapKeyRef: values associated to a key i a `ConfigMap`
- secretKeyRef: values associated to a key i a `ConfigMap`

Note that the `metadata.name` value is already injected in the environment variable `HOSTNAME`

### EnvVars: Exercises

#### EnvVars: Exercise 1

Modify the pod definition and create a pod containing a variable NAMESPACE containing the `Pod` namespace.

#### EnvVars: Exercise 2

Modify the pod definition and create a pod containing a variable with a label. Does it work? why?

## ConfigMap

A `ConfigMap` allow you inject files in your pod. The `ConfigMap` content can be modified, so that the new file content is distributed to all the pod using that config map.

You can create a `ConfigMap` from file or directory directly using `kubectl`:

```console
➜ kubectl create configmap myconfig --from-file=configfolder
configmap "myconfig" created
```

Let's check the content of the create object:

```console
➜ kubectl get cm myconfig -oyaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  file1.txt: content of file1
  file2.txt: content of file 2
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-06-10T07:46:16Z"
  name: myconfig
  namespace: labkube
  resourceVersion: "194477"
  uid: cb8a5d99-be68-4219-ad1d-12a3ed7def30
```

Let's consume that `ConfigMap` in our pod.

First let's use environment variables with deployment-1

```console
➜ kubectl create -f deployment-1.yaml
deployment "labkube-cm" created
```

Here the section that was added to the deployment

```yaml
        env:
        - name: KEY_FROM_CM
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: myconfig
              key: file1.txt
```

Check the container environment:

```console
➜ kubectl exec labkube-cm-bdc6b5749-8sqsx -- env
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
HOSTNAME=labkube-cm-bdc6b5749-8sqsx
KEY_FROM_CM=content of file1
MY_DEPLOYMENT=My deployment is labkube-cm
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS=443
KUBERNETES_PORT=tcp://10.96.0.1:443
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP=tcp://10.96.0.1:443
...
```

Now let's make a deployment that consume the `ConfigMap` as files

```console
➜ kubectl create -f deployment-2.yaml 
deployment "labkube-cmfile" created
```

In our deployment we had to append 2 sections:

- One to declare a volume and associate it to the `ConfigMap`
- One to mount the volume in the container

```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: cedriclamoriniere/labkube:v1
        ...
        volumeMounts:
        - name: configmap-volume
          mountPath: /etc/cm
      volumes:
        - name: configmap-volume
          configMap:
            name: myconfig
```

### ConfigMap Exercises

#### ConfigMap Exercise 1

Enter the pod generated by the last deployment and find where the file was injected. Check the content of the file.

#### ConfigMap Exercise 2

Change the content of the `ConfigMap` using `edit`. Check that the file is modified inside you pod.
